	abstract = {The ability of soft{,} coarse-grained models to describe the narrow interface of a nearly incompressible polymer melt in contact with a solid is explored by numerical self-consistent field calculations and Monte-Carlo simulations. We investigate the effect of the discreteness of the bead-spring architecture by quantitatively comparing the results of a bead-spring model with different number of beads{,} N{,} but identical end-to-end distance{,} Re{,} and a continuous Gaussian-thread model. If the width{,} ξ{,} of the narrow polymer--solid contact is smaller or comparable to the length of a statistical segment{,} {,} strong differences in the interface tension and the density profiles between the two models are observed{,} and strategies for compensating the discrete nature of the bead-spring model are investigated. Compensating the discretization of the chain contour in the bead-spring model by applying an external segment--solid potential{,} we simultaneously adjust the interface tension and the density profile to the predictions of the Gaussian-thread model. We suggest that the geometry of the polymer--solid contact and the interface tension are relevant characteristics that a coarse-grained model of polymer--solid contacts must reproduce in order to establish a quantitative relationship to an experimental system.},

@article{Baschnagel03,
	abstract = {This paper presents a topical overview of molecular-dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations for polymer systems close to solid interfaces. The simulations utilize simplified coarse-grained models: The polymers are represented by bead-spring chains, and the walls by a crystalline layer of Lennard-Jones particles or by a smooth impenetrable barrier. This approach has two advantages. First, it reduces the complexity of the simulation. Often, it is only then possible that the interesting length and time scales can be studied at all. Second, the approach concentrates on generic features that are believed to determine the physics of the problem under consideration. The results of the simulation can thus help to single out those features which should be incorporated in an analytical treatment. In this paper, we want to illustrate the versatility of these models by applying them to a broad spectrum of different problems. The situations considered range from the adsorption of a polymer from dilute solution onto a wall, over the importance of sub-monolayer monomeric or polymeric lubricants for kinetic friction, to the crystallization or glass transition of dense polymer films.},

@article{Mai_diblock_selfassembly,
	abstract = {Block copolymer (BCP) self-assembly has attracted considerable attention for many decades because it can yield ordered structures in a wide range of morphologies{,} including spheres{,} cylinders{,} bicontinuous structures{,} lamellae{,} vesicles{,} and many other complex or hierarchical assemblies. These aggregates provide potential or practical applications in many fields. The present tutorial review introduces the primary principles of BCP self-assembly in bulk and in solution{,} by describing experiments{,} theories{,} accessible morphologies and morphological transitions{,} factors affecting the morphology{,} thermodynamics and kinetics{,} among others. As one specific example at a more advanced level{,} BCP vesicles (polymersomes) and their potential applications are discussed in some detail.},
